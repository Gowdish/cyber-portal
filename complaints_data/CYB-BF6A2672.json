    "ai_assistance": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a clear, step-by-step guide on how to handle a potential phishing situation, along with tips for future prevention:\n\n### Step 1: Do Not Click on or Visit the Detected URLs\n- **Awareness:** Recognize that the links identified as phishing may lead to websites designed to steal personal information.\n- **Avoid Interaction:** If you receive a notification of a phishing link, refrain from visiting or clicking on it. Simply close the alert or message.\n\n### Step 2: Change Passwords for Any Accounts Accessed\n- **Immediate Action:** If you have clicked on a phishing link or entered your credentials, assume your information might be compromised.\n- **Password Changes:**\n   1. Go to the website of the account you've accessed (e.g., email, banking).\n   2. Use the official method to change your password (often found under 'Settings' or 'Account').\n   3. Create a strong password; combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n### Step 3: Run a Security Scan on Your Device\n- **Use Antivirus Software:**\n   1. Open your antivirus software.\n   2. Run a full scan of your device to detect and remove any possible malware that may have been installed.\n- **Update Software:** Ensure your antivirus and all software are updated to the latest versions to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Use Anti-malware Tools:** If available, consider using additional anti-malware tools to run a thorough check of your device.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Phishing Links in the Future\n- **Check the URL:**\n   - Look for unusual domain names, such as misspellings or extra characters (e.g., \"example.com\" vs. \"examp1e.com\").\n   - Legitimate companies usually use their official domains and subdomains.\n  \n- **Look for HTTPS:**\n   - Secure sites typically start with \"https://\" rather than \"http://\". However, the presence of HTTPS alone is not a guarantee of safety.\n  \n- **Examine Email and Message Sources:**\n   - Be cautious of unsolicited messages or emails that urge immediate action.\n   - Hover over links to see where they truly lead before clicking; this can often be done without clicking the link itself.\n\n- **Beware of Urgency and Threats:** \n   - Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt immediate action.\n   - Take your time to assess",
