Ensure that you use strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store them securely.\n\n### Step 2: Overcome the Current Problem\n1. **Scan for Malware:**\n   - Use a reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to conduct a full scan on your device. Ensure that the software is up to date.\n   \n2. **Remove Suspicious Apps:**\n   - If you suspect that the application \"Rimichka\" was the source of the issue, uninstall it from your device immediately.\n   - Go to your device settings, find 'Apps' or 'Applications,' locate \"Rimichka,\" and select 'Uninstall.'\n\n3. **Check for Other Malware:**\n   - After removing the suspicious app, repeat the malware scan to ensure no other threats exist.\n\n4. **Back-Up Important Data:**\n   - Ensure you have backups of important files and documents regularly. If you haven't made backups recently, consider doing so after ensuring your device is clean.\n\n### Step 3: Protect Themselves in the Future\n1. **Install Updates:**\n   - Regularly update your operating system, applications, and antivirus software to make sure you have the latest security patches.\n   \n2. **Be Cautious with Downloads:**\n   - Only download applications from official app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, etc.) and review permissions before installation. If an app does not need certain permissions, avoid granting them.\n\n3. **Use Anti-virus Software:**\n   - Consider installing reputable antivirus or endpoint protection solutions that provide real-time protection against malware.\n   \n4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n   - For your accounts that support it, enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security.\n   \n5. **Educate Yourself:**\n   - Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices. Understanding malware tactics can help you avoid falling victim in the future",
