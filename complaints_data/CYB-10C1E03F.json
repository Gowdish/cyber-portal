Here are some proactive practices to help keep your online experience safe:\n\n1. **Be Cautious with Links from Unknown Sources**: Always think twice before clicking on links or downloading files from unfamiliar emails or websites. Even if something appears safe at first glance, it\u2019s better to verify first.\n\n2. **Verify the Authenticity of Documents and Their Senders**: If you receive unexpected documents or messages, double-check the sender\u2019s email address and reach out directly to confirm their legitimacy.\n\n3. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Create complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and ensure you use different passwords for different accounts. This helps protect your information in the event of a data breach.\n\n4. **Ongoing Vigilance is Key**: Cyber threats are constantly evolving, so it\u2019s important to remain alert even after a positive security check. Regularly monitor your accounts and be aware of any unusual activity.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can significantly reduce your risk and maintain a safer online environment.
