Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you handle such a situation effectively:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### Step 1: **Do Not Click on or Visit the Detected URLs**\n- If you see any malicious links, avoid clicking on them. Instead, close the page or document and do not engage with them in any way.\n\n#### Step 2: **Change Passwords for Any Accounts Accessed**\n- If you have already clicked on a link and entered your login information:\n  1. Navigate to the website of the accounts you may have accessed (e.g., email, bank, social media).\n  2. Use a different device if possible to ensure security.\n  3. Go to the login page and select the option for \"Forgot Password\" or \"Change Password.\"\n  4. Follow the steps provided to create a new password. Ensure that your new password is strong, using a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\n#### Step 3: **Run a Full Security Scan on Your Device**\n- Use a reputable antivirus or anti-malware program:\n  1.
