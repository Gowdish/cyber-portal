Avoid Clicking on URLs\n- **Do Not Click**: If you have identified that a URL is suspicious or confirmed as phishing, refrain from clicking on it further. This includes links in emails, text messages, or any online content.\n\n#### 2. Change Your Passwords\n- **Identify Accounts**: Think of any accounts you may have accessed after clicking on the phishing link (email, banking, social media, etc.).\n- **Change Passwords**:\n  - Go to the official website of the service.\n  - Use a different device if you suspect malware.\n  - Access the account settings and locate the password change option.\n  - Create a strong, unique password, ideally using a password manager.\n- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: If available, enable 2FA for added security.\n\n#### 3. Run a Security Scan\n- **Update Security Software**: Ensure your antivirus and antimalware software are up to date.\n- **Run a Full Scan**: \n  - Open your security software.\n  - Select the option for a full system scan and initiate it.\n  - Follow any prompts if the software detects threats.\n- **Remove Threats**: Follow instructions to quarantine or delete any identified malware.\n\n#### 4. Identify Phishing Links in the Future\n- **Check the URL**: Hover over links (without clicking) to see the actual URL. Look for misspellings, extra characters, or mismatched domain names.\n- **Look for HTTPS**: Legitimate websites typically use HTTPS. Although HTTPS does not guarantee legitimacy, phishing sites often lack it.\n- **Check the Email Source**: Inspect the sender's email address; it may appear close to a legitimate address but often has slight differences.\n- **Beware of Red Flags**: Look out for overly urgent language, grammatical errors, or offers that seem too good to be true.\n\n#### 5. Report the Phishing Attempt\n- **Report to Email Provider**: \n  - Most email clients (like Gmail, Outlook) have an option to report phishing or spam.\n- **Report to Website or Service**: If the phishing attempt impersonated a company, inform them via their official website or customer service.\n- **Notify Authorities**: \n  - In the U.S., report phishing to the Federal Trade",
