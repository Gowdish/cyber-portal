    "ai_assistance": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a clear, step-by-step guide to help you handle phishing links and improve your online security.\n\n### Step 1: DO NOT click on or visit the detected URLs.\n- **Action**: If you've identified a URL as phishing, refrain from interacting with it. Ensure your browser or device does not inadvertently redirect you to the site.\n- **Tip**: Close any browser tabs that may contain the malicious links, and avoid pasting the link into your browser.\n\n### Step 2: If you have already clicked on a link, immediately change passwords for any accounts you may have accessed.\n- **Action**: Go to each of your accounts (email, banking, social media, etc.) and change your passwords. Use strong, unique passwords that combine letters, numbers, and special characters.\n- **Tip**: Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.\n\n### Step 3: Run a security scan on your device.\n- **Action**: Use updated antivirus or anti-malware software to perform a full system scan.\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Open your antivirus software.\n  2. Select the option for a full system scan.\n  3. Allow the scan to complete and follow any prompts to remove detected threats.\n- **Tip**: Ensure your security software is regularly updated for optimal protection.\n\n### Step 4: Explain how to identify phishing links in the future.\n- **Look for Suspicious URLs**: Check for misspellings or variations in the domain name (e.g., \u201cfaceb00k.com\u201d vs. \u201cfacebook.com\u201d).\n- **Hover Over Links**: Hover your mouse over any link (without clicking) to see the actual URL. Ensure it matches the expected website.\n- **Be Wary of Urgency**: Phishing attempts often create a sense of urgency, prompting quick action without careful consideration.\n- **Check for Generic Greetings**: Phishing emails often use generic salutations (e.g., \"Dear User\") rather than personal ones.\n- **Look for Poor Grammar and Spelling**: Many phishing messages contain errors in spelling or grammar.\n- **Avoid Unsolicited Requests**: Be cautious of unexpected emails or messages asking for personal information, especially from unknown sources.\n\n### Step 5: Advise on reporting the phishing attempt to the relevant authorities or service providers.\n- **Report to Email Provider**: If the phishing attempt came via email, report it",
