    "ai_assistance": "If you've encountered a document or URL that has been flagged for containing phishing links, it's crucial to respond appropriately to protect your personal information and digital assets. Follow this step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. DO NOT click on or visit the detected URLs.\n- **Avoid Interaction**: Be cautious and do not click on any links within the document or URL. Phishing links can lead to malicious websites that may compromise your personal data.\n\n#### 2. If you have already clicked on a link, immediately change passwords for any accounts you may have accessed.\n- **Identify Affected Accounts**: Consider all accounts you accessed after clicking the link (e.g., email, online banking, social media).\n- **Change Passwords**: Use a strong, unique password for each account. Ideally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.\n- **Monitor Accounts**: Check for unauthorized activity on your accounts and report any suspicious transactions immediately.\n\n#### 3. Run a security scan on your device.\n- **Install Security Software**: If you do not have an antivirus or anti-malware program, download a reputable one.\n- **Perform a Full Scan**: Run a complete scan of your device to detect and remove any malicious software.\n- **Follow Recommendations**: If threats are detected, follow the software\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them.\n\n#### 4. Explain how to identify phishing links in the future.\n- **Check the URL**: Look for subtle misspellings or unusual domain names (e.g., \u201cpaypal.com\u201d vs. \u201cpaypa1.com\u201d). \n- **Hover Over Links**: Without clicking, hover over the link to see the actual URL it points to in the status bar of your browser.\n- **Look for HTTPS**: Ensure that the website uses HTTPS (located before the URL). While not foolproof, it indicates a more secure connection.\n- **Be Skeptical of Urgency**: Phishing attempts often create a sense of urgency (e.g., \u201cImmediate action required!\u201d). Approach such messages with caution.\n- **Verify the Source**: Always confirm the sender\u2019s email address or the source of the message. Contact the institution directly using official contact information, rather than replying to the email.\n\n#### 5. Advise on reporting the phishing attempt to the relevant authorities or service providers.\n- **Report to Your Email Provider**: Use the \"Report Phishing\" feature in your email",
