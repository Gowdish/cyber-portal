Here's a clear, step-by-step guide on how to handle malicious or high-risk phishing links:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### Step 1: Avoid Clicking on Known Malicious Links\n- **Do not click on the detected URLs**: This is the most critical step. Avoid visiting any links you know to be malicious, as this can lead to malware installation or data theft.\n\n#### Step 2: Change Passwords\n- **Immediately change passwords**: If you have already clicked on a link and entered any sensitive information (like passwords or financial details), change the passwords for those accounts right away. \n  - Go to each website directly (not through the phishing link) and use the \"Forgot Password?\" feature if you can't remember them. \n  - Create strong, unique passwords for each account.\n\n#### Step 3: Run a Security Scan\n- **Perform a full security scan** on your device:\n  - Use reliable antivirus software to perform a complete scan of your computer. Follow these steps:\n    1. Ensure your antivirus software is up to date.\n    2. Open the software and select the option for a full system scan.\n    3. Allow the scan to remove any detected threats.\n  - Additionally, consider using anti-malware tools for a thorough check.\n\n#### Step 4: Identifying Phishing Links in the Future\n- **Learn to spot phishing attempts**:\n  - **Check the domain name closely**: Look for minor misspellings or extra characters in the URL. For example, \"g00gle.com\" instead of \"google.com\".\n  - **Look for generic messages**: Phishing emails often use generic greetings (e.g., \"Dear Customer\") instead of your name. Be wary of any messages that create a sense of urgency or fear.\n  - **Hover before you click**: If you mouse over a link, it will show the actual URL. Check if it looks suspicious.\n  - **Examine the sender\u2019s email**: Phishing attempts often come from email addresses that mimic legitimate ones but have slight variations.\n\n#### Step 5: Reporting the Phishing Attempt\n- **Report the phishing attempt**:\n  - **To your email provider**: Most email services have a way to report phishing emails. Look for \"Report Phishing\" options.\n  - **To the websites being impersonated**: If the phishing email is pretending to be from a legitimate company, report it to",
