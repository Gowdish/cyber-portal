    "ai_assistance": "### Immediate Action Plan for Mitigating the Phishing Attack\n\n**Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet**\n- Immediately disconnect your device from the internet. This can prevent any potential unauthorized access or data leakage.\n\n**Step 2: Change Your Passwords**\n- Change your email password (gowdish2005@gmail.com) and any other accounts that might use the same or similar passwords. Make sure to use a strong password that includes upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.\n- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.\n\n**Step 3: Review Account Activity**\n- Check your email account for any suspicious activities such as unauthorized changes to your account settings or sent messages that you did not authorize.\n\n### Overcoming Current Problems\n\n**Step 4: Report the Phishing Attempt**\n- Report the phishing email to your email service provider (e.g., Gmail) by selecting the email and clicking on the \"Report phishing\" option.\n- Additionally, report the incident to the relevant authorities (e.g., Cyber Crime Cell) to help combat phishing attempts.\n\n**Step 5: Scan Your Device for Malware**\n- Use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to scan your device for any potential malware or unwanted software that may have been installed as a result of the phishing attempt.\n- Remove any detected threats and ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date.\n\n### Protecting Yourself in the Future\n\n**Step 6: Educate Yourself on Phishing Techniques**\n- Familiarize yourself with common phishing tactics, such as suspicious email addresses, urgent calls to action, and unexpected attachments or links.\n- Always double-check the URL in emails by hovering over links before clicking to confirm they lead to legitimate sites.\n\n**Step 7: Use Email Filtering Tools**\n- Enable spam filters and phishing detection tools provided by your email service. This can help filter out suspicious emails before they reach your inbox.\n\n**Step 8: Regularly Update Your Software**\n- Keep your operating system, software applications, and security tools updated to ensure you have the latest security patches that protect you from vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 9: Backup Important Data**\n- Regularly back up your important files to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This will help you recover your data in case of future incidents.\n\n### Closing the Case\n\n**Step 10: Assess Your Readiness to Close the Case**\n- Once you have completed the above steps and feel secure,",
