Navigate to the login page of each affected account.\n     2. Click on the \"Forgot Password?\" link if you can\u2019t log in.\n     3. Follow the password reset process to create a strong, new password.\n   - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: If available, enable two-factor authentication for added security.\n\n### 3. **Run a Full Security Scan on Your Device**\n   - **Install Antivirus Software**: Make sure you have reputable antivirus software installed.\n   - **Initiate a Full Scan**:\n     1. Open your antivirus program.\n     2. Select the option for a full system scan.\n     3. Start the scan and allow it to complete. Follow any recommendations to remove detected threats.\n   - **Update Your Security Software**: After scanning, ensure your antivirus is updated to the latest version to protect against new threats.\n\n### 4. **Identify Phishing Links in the Future**\n   - **Check the Domain Name**: Always verify the URL closely. Look for minor misspellings or unusual domain suffixes (e.g., \".net\" instead of \".com\").\n   - **Hover Over Links**: Before clicking, hover your mouse cursor over the link (without clicking) to see the actual URL in the bottom corner of your browser.\n   - **Look for Red Flags**: Phishing attempts often contain generic greetings (like \u201cDear Customer\u201d) and create a sense of urgency (e.g., \u201cYour account will be suspended\u201d).\n   - **Verify Suspicious Communications**: If you receive messages from what seems to be a legitimate source, contact them directly using verified contact information",
