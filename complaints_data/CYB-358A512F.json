    "ai_assistance": "Here is a clear, step-by-step guide to help you deal with phishing links and avoid them in the future:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n#### 1. **DO NOT click on or visit the detected URLs.**\n   - If you see a link suspected of being phishing, avoid clicking on it altogether. Close the tab or the application in which the link was encountered. Always exercise caution when you receive unknown links or emails.\n\n#### 2. **If you have already clicked on a link, immediately change passwords for any accounts you may have accessed.**\n   - Go to the official website of the service you logged into (do not use any links). Use the \"Forgot password\" feature if needed, and create a strong, unique password that you haven\u2019t used before. Also, consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.\n\n#### 3. **Run a security scan on your device.**\n   - Use reliable antivirus or antimalware software to perform a full scan of your device. This will help detect and remove any malicious software that may have been installed unintentionally. Ensure your security software is updated to the latest version before running the scan.\n\n#### 4. **How to identify phishing links in the future:**\n   - **Check the URL:** Phishing links often have unusual or misspelled domains. Before clicking any link, hover over it to see the actual URL. Look for discrepancies or anything that seems out of place.\n   - **Look for HTTPS:** Legitimate sites often use HTTPS instead of HTTP. While this is not a foolproof method, the absence of HTTPS can be a red flag.\n   - **Be cautious with emails:** If you receive emails urging immediate action, look for signs of phishing such as typos, generic greetings, or unfamiliar sender addresses.\n   - **Verify the source:** If the link is sent via email or a message, contact the sender directly to verify the authenticity of the link, using contact methods you know to be safe (not the contact details in the email).\n   - **Use a link scanner:** Online tools like VirusTotal can help you check if a link is safe before clicking.\n\n#### 5. **Advise on reporting the phishing attempt to relevant authorities or service providers.**\n   - Report phishing emails to the email provider (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) by marking them as spam or using the \"Report Phishing\" option.\n   - Forward phishing emails to the Anti-Ph",
