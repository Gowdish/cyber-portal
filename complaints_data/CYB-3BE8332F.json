    "ai_assistance": "If you've received a notification about malicious or high-risk phishing links, it\u2019s crucial to take immediate and careful action. Follow this step-by-step guide:\n\n### 1. **DO NOT Click on the Detected URLs**\n   - **Stay Calm**: First and foremost, refrain from clicking on any links.\n   - **Close the Document/Email**: If you\u2019re viewing it in a browser or email client, close it immediately without interacting with any elements.\n\n### 2. **Change Passwords for Accessed Accounts**\n   - **Identify Accounts**: Think about any accounts you may have accessed after clicking the link, including email, banking, or online shopping accounts.\n   - **Use Strong Passwords**: Change each password by using a unique and complex combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.\n   - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: If available, enable this feature for an extra layer of security on your accounts.\n\n### 3. **Run a Full Security Scan on Your Device**\n   - **Update Your Antivirus Software**: Ensure your security software is up to date.\n   - **Launch a Full Scan**: Use the antivirus software to perform a complete scan of your device to detect any potential malware or viruses that may have been downloaded.\n   - **Follow Recommendations**: If any threats are detected, follow the software\u2019s guidance to remove them.\n\n### 4. **How to Identify Phishing Links in the Future**\n   - **Check the Domain Name**: Look closely at the URL. Phishing attempts often use misspelled or slightly altered domains (e.g., \"g00gle.com\" instead of \"google.com\").\n   - **Look for HTTPS**: Legitimate websites should use HTTPS. If the site is not secure, think twice before entering any information.\n   - **Generic Messages**: Be wary of messages that are generic and lack personalization (e.g., \"Dear Customer\" instead of your name).\n   - **Suspicious Requests**: Emails or messages asking for urgent action, verification information, or personal details are red flags.\n   - **Too Good to Be True Offers**: If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Approaching these offers with skepticism can help you avoid scams.\n\n### 5. **Reporting the Phishing Attempt**\n   - **To Service Providers**: Report phishing attempts to the relevant service provider (e.g., your email service, Google, etc.):",
