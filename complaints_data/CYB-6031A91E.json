    "ai_assistance": "### Immediate Action Plan to Mitigate the Phishing Incident\n\n#### Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet\n- **Disconnect your device from the Internet** to prevent any unauthorized access. This can be done by turning off Wi-Fi or unplugging your Ethernet cable.\n\n#### Step 2: Change Passwords\n- **Change your passwords immediately** for any accounts that may be associated with the email mentioned in the phishing attempt (e.g., gowdish2005@gmail.com). \n- Use a strong, unique password for each account. If you suspect that the phishing attempt may have given an attacker your password, ensure you use a different device to change it.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for Unauthorized Activity\n- **Review your email and other accounts** for any unauthorized activity. Look for logins you don't recognize or strange messages sent from your accounts.\n\n### Overcoming Current Issues\n\n#### Step 4: Report the Phishing Attempt\n- **Report the phishing email to your email provider** (e.g., Gmail) using their reporting tools. This helps them improve their filters and protects other users from similar scams.\n- Additionally, consider forwarding the email to the Government of India\u2019s cybercrime reporting email at: cybercrime@nic.in, or check official government websites for reporting phishing attempts.\n\n#### Step 5: Scan Your Device\n- **Run a full antivirus and anti-malware scan** on your device using trusted software. Ensure the software is updated to the latest version to effectively identify and remove any potential threats.\n\n### Protecting Yourself in the Future\n\n#### Step 6: Educate Yourself on Phishing Scams\n- **Familiarize yourself with common traits of phishing emails**:\n  - Check for spelling or grammatical errors.\n  - Be cautious of unsolicited emails that create a sense of urgency or require immediate action.\n  - Verify the sender's email address by checking for slight variations such as misspellings.\n\n#### Step 7: Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication** on your email and other important accounts. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.\n\n#### Step 8: Regularly Monitor Accounts\n- **Regularly check your financial and online accounts** for any unusual activity. Set up alerts for transactions or changes to accounts where possible.\n\n#### Step 9: Use a Password Manager\n- **Consider using a password manager** to help you create and manage strong, unique",
